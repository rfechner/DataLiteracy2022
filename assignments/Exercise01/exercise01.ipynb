Our classifier of course assigns the probability of this word occuring to 0, which is not incorrect, based upon the training data we've seen. Thus, our classifier cannot decide, whether the instance is a spam or ham instance. We can see this very clearly taking a look at the accuracy for the test set in the previous cell.
